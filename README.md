# rectiloafier

A path or polygon is considered "rectilinear" if all of its angles are at 90° or 270°, and all of its lines are parallel to one of the Cartesian axes. Rectilinear polygons have the special property of being able to be broken into rectangles losslessly. This simple crate provides utilities to determine if a path or polygon is rectilinear, as well as to break it down into rectangles if it is.
